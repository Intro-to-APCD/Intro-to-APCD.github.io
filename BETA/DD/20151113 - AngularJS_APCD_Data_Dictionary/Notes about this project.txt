These are the current fields:


    "ReleaseLevel":2,
    "DataElementSource":"Derived-DC1",
    "DataElementName":"Submission Month",
    "CHIA_Notes":"Required by IT for internal linkage",
    "NetezzaColumnName":"RIGHT([SUBMISSIONYEARMONTH],2) as \"SubmissionMonth\"",
    "Other_NOTE":"",
    "DataType":"int",
    "DataLength":"2",
    "FLAG_Carrier_Specific_TLKP":null,
    "FieldType":"Derived",
    "Hashed":"",
    "Redaction":"",
    "Description":"",
    "ElementSubmissionGuideline":"",
    "Condition":"NA",
    "ThresholdPercent":"NA",
    "Category":"NA"



I need to add:
1.  The submission guideline when the variable was first introduced.
2.  The submission guideline when the variable was most recently changed/modified
3.  Notes about the "Completeness" of the variable.  i.e. number of missing values, any carrier specific variances
4.  A note to say if the field is PHI, PII, or if it becomes PHI/PII when combined with some other field(s).






Dave Berube may be able to help me populate some of these data fields.




"2016 Q2 Release" is going to be the next big release.  After that, the goal is to release new features every quarter.  So there will  be a total of 3 releases in 2016.
