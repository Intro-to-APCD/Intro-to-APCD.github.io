## 1 Introduction
The Payment and Rewards Management System for the Smoothie carts will reward the most loyal customers for their purchases made by a credit card.

## 2 Business Needs /Requirements
A great deal of work goes into getting the first round of customers. Once you get the customers, the important part is to retain them and keep them satisfied. If you do not incentivize them, they will not return for a next purchase and will easily get bored with the services. The fact is that there are multiple companies offering the same service, we need to go out of our way and do something more than providing customers with smoothies for a fixed rate. For this reason:
 
- We need to build a reward management system that will reward good customers. 
- This software will keep track of customer's purchases and reward large transactions. We also plan on giving them discounts after a particular amount of purchase. 
- This will make people buy more and visit the cart often in search of good deals and great smoothies.

## 3 Product /Solution Overview
- The product we are building is an Android app that will take the customer information, including the credit card as input and reward them with dollar credit on a purchase of a particular amount.
- The customer is provided with a customer card with his/her first purchase which keeps track of the rewards earned.
- This makes a customer want to buy more smoothies and visit the cart more often to get more points and get lower rates on his/her next purchase. 
- It benefits Brad and Janet (the owners of Smoothie cart) to keep their customers satisfied/happy and be successful in their business. 

## 4 Major Features (Optional)
Same as the Product/Solution overview and the requirements. 

## 5 Scope and Limitations
The scope of the product includes the following:

- It will serve the customers with a rewards management system that will keep track of all the purchases made by the customer
- It will reward the customer with dollar credit on a purchase made of some particular dollar amount
- We will provide an android app for the manager to keep track of his/her customers and their rewards
- The product will also take care of applying the reward on the next purchase
- It will also monitor the date of rewards received and its expiration
- The manager will also be able to look up for a customer and his/her details at any point in time
- The system will be able to read the customer ID from customer card with the help of a QR scanner
- The system will support payments made by credit card

The limitations of the product are as follows:

- The system does not handle deleting a customer from the system
- No other payment modes, except credit card are supported
- Once the smoothie order has been placed, you can either process the transaction or start over again. System does not support editing the order. 
- The system is designed for a single user and does not support concurrent users or user logins.
