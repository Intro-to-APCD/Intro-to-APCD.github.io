# Vision Document

**Author**: Spyridon Ganas



## 1 Introduction
The "Introduction to the APCD for Healthcare Researchers" website will teach researchers how to conduct medical and healthcare research using the All-Payer Claims Database.

## 2 Business Needs 
The All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) is a multi-terabyte data warehouse that stored detailed medical records.  
This data is available  to qualified researchers.  There is a clear need for a resource to help researchers understand the available  data and the process for accessing that data.



## 3 Project Overview
- The "Introduction to the APCD for Healthcare Researchers" website is a curated collection of resources related to the APCD and the analysis of medical claims data.

## 4 Potential Features 
- Links to existing websites and PDFs.
- An "Intro to claims data" section that will explain ICD codes, CPT codes, different billing methods, etc.
- A "Behind the Scenes" video that explains how the data flows from insurance carriers to the APCD to researchers.
- A library of published papers that used the APCD data.



## 5 Scope and Limitations
The scope of the project includes the following:

- A website.
- A YouTube site that hosts at least 20 hours of videos featuring APCD experts.


The limitations of the product are as follows:

- This website will focus on the Massachusetts version of the APCD.
- This project must be completed by the end of the Spring 2016 term (May 5, 2016).
- This website will not contain any actual APCD data, confidential data, or anything that would not be releasable under a Freedom-of-Information request.
