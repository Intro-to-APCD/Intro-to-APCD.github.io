## 2 Process Description

<br>
- Activity Name: **Vision Document** </br>
- Activity description: The vision document  </br> 
- Entrance criteria: Requirements as laid down by Brad and Janet. More refined information will be captured from the end customer. </br>
- Exit criteria: Clear understanding by all the team members about the sections included. </br>
</br>







- Activity name: **Design Document** </br>
- Activity description: This document will capture the details about how the various parts of the software and how they work. This document is aimed at providing a common vocabulary about the project across all the team members. The document will encompass the Design considerations that consists of Assumptions, Constraints and system environment. The document will also contain the architectural design like the deployment diagram and the component diagram. The other section in the document will be a low-level design that will have class diagram and other diagrams as needed. The last section will contain the user interface design. </br>
- Entrance criteria: Addressing the requirements given by Brad and Jane who are our customers. </br>
- Exit criteria: The document will cover all the aspects of a software design and will be signed off by all the team members. </br>














- Activity name: **Use Case Model** </br>
- Activity description: The Use Case Model will describe the proposed functionality of the system. A Use Case will represent the interaction between the User and the system. The specification will also include the Requirements, Constraints and Scenarios. It will be represented by Actor, Use Case and Associations. It may be extended to represent generalization and dependencies. </br>
- Entrance criteria: The design document will feed in the data to create a use case model </br>
- Exit criteria: A User Case Diagram that is accepted and understood by all the team members. It should also accelerate the understanding of personas to be implemented in the system. </br>
</br>
- Activity name: **Supplementary Requirements Document** </br>
- Activity description: This document talks about all the non-functional requirements that does not fit the use case model. </br>
- Entrance criteria: Requirements as given in the project description </br>
- Exit criteria: A list of non-functional requirements understood and agreed upon by the team members </br>

</br>
- Activity name: **Developing the App (Source Code and Executable)** </br>
- Activity description: This is about developing the android application that will be used by Brad and Jane to reward their customers for buying smoothies. </br>
- Entrance criteria: Design document will be the driver of the implementation code. along with it the other documents will aid to the understanding of the whole product and the system </br>
- Exit criteria: A working android app satisfying all the requirements </br>
</br>
