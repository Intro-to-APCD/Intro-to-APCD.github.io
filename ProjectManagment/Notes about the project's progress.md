#Notes about the Project's Progress  
  
1. I created an “administrative simplification” presentation by merging the risk adjustment and GIC topics  
2. “what is a provider?” topic gets merged into the provider overview presentation  
3.  I was planning to do a data dictionary for the Massachusetts APCD.  But instead I'm going to link to every states data dictionary or submission guidelines.
4.  I reorganized the webpage from using "APCD Terminology" and "Advanced topics"  to  "Insurance Industry Terminology" and "Claims Terminology"
5.  I decided not to make an overview for the Dental data, because dental data is almost never used by researchers.
