#Notes about the Project's Progress  
  
1. I created an “administrative simplification” presentation by merging the risk adjustment and GIC topics  
2. “what is a provider?” topic gets merged into the provider overview presentation  
3.  I was planning to do a data dictionary for the Massachusetss APCD.  But instead I'm going to link to every states data dictionary or submission guidleines.
